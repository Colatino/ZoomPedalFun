I can see when one shares other ZDLs that likely the FXID and GID changes.
As of now I cannot work out the Sysex to set a FXID/GID
Worse, it seems I can change the 1st two bytes of a given FXID in sysex
BUT it does not seem to get the GID
and if pedal is in bypass the parameter values will not accept injection.

So it seems the only way is to send FULL sysex except this isnt what
Tonelib, 1-Controller etc are doing.
Indeed I dont know what they are doing.

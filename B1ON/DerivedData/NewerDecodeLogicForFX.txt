Using the FLST_SEQ to grab ZDLs in group order.

Decoding FXID/GID with C++ (notice numbers need to be divided by two for physical values!)
Checking byted 0x40 - 47 from ZDL file
40,41 is FXID in reverse order
42,43 is GID ... some bit shifting needed
44.47 is ASCII version

b0 & 1 == 1 => On else Off

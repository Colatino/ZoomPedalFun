The Zeroed out patches are as Factory EXCEPT all params were set to 0.
This allows us to see the FXID/GID in the first 4 bytes of the processed output


TotalDecode.txt has the decoded factory values then the decoded "0" values.
I will be checking this against the pedal and Mungewell suggested to compare with values from ToneLib.

I will put GCE-3 data in here

First useful info:

When you emulate a pedal on your GCE-3 then majority of its functionality works.
Looper and rhythm does not always work but the patches and FX are stored on the pedal.

This means you can, with midi command, change patch.
And for the "4" models (B1XFour etc) it is possible to edit FX's, parameter values in real time.
